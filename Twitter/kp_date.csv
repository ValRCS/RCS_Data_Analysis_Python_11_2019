2,Did Dallas truly beat the Knicks in the KP trade?,0,cqgz75,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cqgz75/did_dallas_truly_beat_the_knicks_in_the_kp_trade/,22,1565850372.0,"Last season in the league:

Julius Randle (21.4 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 3.1 ast, 55.5% efg, 24.7 years old, played 310 games last 4 years, no long term injury since rookie year, makes 21 million per over 2 years with a 3rd year team option in summer 2021)

 Kristaps Porzingis (22.7 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.2 ast, 49% efg, 24.0 years old, 186 games last 4 years which is less than Tatum, coming off torn ACL at 7’3 with torn ligaments, 32 million per over 5 years w/player option) 

\*Remember losing KP also gave the Knicks two 1st rounders, DSJ, about 40 million in salary, and an open spot at PF to sign Randle in the first place 

Personally, I gotta give it to the Knicks and here is why. While KP clearly has the higher ceiling he is not only coming off an ACL injury at 7'3, but also is set to make 11 million more per year which allows the Knicks another 2nd max slot going forward that a 32 million dollar max signing wouldn't allow them. Not to mention KP got the Knicks DSJ (who is still a young player that's a league average jumper away from having a DLo type year imo), and 2 first round picks in 2021/2023. I mean, if KP reaches his ceiling and Randle stagnates or gets worse I could see this backfiring but until KP proves he is a top 10-15 player, I just don't see how Dallas won this trade.",Randle is completely irrelevant to the trade,Why have i seen “julius is basically just as good as porzingis” multiple times today?

23,[OC] A Genuine Unicorn: Finding a historical comp for Kristaps Porzingis,40,dgi66a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dgi66a/oc_a_genuine_unicorn_finding_a_historical_comp/,48,1570842710.0,"When Kristaps Porzingis was drafted, he received the title of ""unicorn:"" a mythical player who can protect the rim like a traditional towering big, and shoot 3s like a wing. KP has, amazingly, fully lived up to that moniker, posting one of the highest block rates in the league in 2018 while shooting 3s at over 40%. However, the rest of his game is hugely questionable: he was one of the least efficient volume scorer in the league, posted a historical low assist rate for a volume scorer, and was a very poor rebounder. In order to try and project his career ceiling, I looked for other young players with similar profiles to see where their career ended up.

I first messed around for a while on BBall Ref trying to find other players who put up high scoring rates, collected very few assists, and weren't very efficient. [My first criteria came up with just KP, and 26 year old John Drew](http://bkref.com/tiny/Bqfm4). Loosening it slightly came up with [more John Drew, an old Moses, and some other good but not great players](http://bkref.com/tiny/Bqfm4). Compared to league average TS%, KP is actually at the bottom of this group in efficiency. Loosening the volume scoring criteria [lumps Porzingis with some very good and very bad players](http://bkref.com/tiny/hZtp1), and it becomes clear that this approach isn't gonna be all that revelatory.

I then went for an approach that better reflected his overall two-way game. I found three clubs that seemed fitting for KP:

[Players age 23 and under, 25+ pts/100, 2.5+ blk/100, <2.5 AST/100](http://bkref.com/tiny/oJ6xf)

This captures all 3 of Porzingis's seasons, and lumps him in with a varied group of players. We see him grouped with future superstars like Shaq and Hakeem, a comparable young player in Jaren Jackson Jr, and some solid players like Big Z and McDyess. The only issue is that even within this group, KP is an outlier: his most scoring rate is the highest on the list by far, and he's dead at the bottom of the heap with McDyess in relative TS%. His assist/usage ratio is also the worst of all these players.

[All players, 30+ pts/100, 2.5+ blk/100, <2.5 ast/100](http://bkref.com/tiny/aQfEv)

I removed the age filter in order to find more big volume scoring seasons like Kristaps' 17-18. Here, KPnis grouped exclusively with HoFers and a young Brook Lopez, but he's radically less efficient than the entire rest of the list. His supporting cast was also probably the worst, but Lopez and Davis both also had very rough supporting casts.

[Players age 23 and under, >25% usage, 2.5+ blk/100, <2.5 ast/100](http://bkref.com/tiny/ktmwr)

The group narrows to just Porzingis, McDyess, and HoFers. This reflects the same pattern as before: KP is radically less efficient than other young bigs with high usage, serious defensive talent, and very limited passing.

The reason I keep pinpointing on Porzingis' efficiency is that I don't think it's something that'll just change overnight on a good team. Porzingis shot fantastically from 3 and posted a fairly high free throw rate in 2018. If his shooting regresses and/or his reduced role in Dallas doesn't allow him to draw as many fouls, the efficiency gains he makes from other areas improving could be largely erased. I don't doubt that he'll probably get to above average efficiency as he improves, but I don't think he's ever going to really efficient without taking far less shots.

Overall, Porzingis is a complete outlier, both for better and for worse. I think looking through past comparisons gives a lot of clarity as to what he *isn't*, but does less to illuminate what he *is*. 

The comparison that strikes me most is actually a guy that didn't show up in these comps: **Rasheed Wallace**. Like Porzingis, Wallace was a stretch big with excellent defense, but had limitations that put a ceiling on his offensive impact. Wallace never put up the same scoring rates KP has, but he was more efficient and better as a passer. I think like Wallace, KP can peak as a top 11-15 player in the league, but it's unlikely he'll ever be a franchise player type guy. 

**TLDR:** Kristaps Porzingis is much better on defense than other inefficient young volume scorers, but much less efficient than other young volume scoring defensive bigs. He's also really fucking bad at passing. IMO he will probably peak as an All-NBA level guy, but not a franchise player.","yall want KP to be steve nash now? 

""he will peak as an all nba level guy"" he said this like it was a diss","KP went from being a bit underrated as a Knick to overrated when he left. Even if you disregard the health issues he has some very major flaws in his game. His efficiency in the second half of the season has been abysmal every year of his career, and he's a god awful passer. His rim protection and 3 point shooting is special though. In addition to actually being healthy he has to improve *a lot* to be worth that max contract. Agree that his peak is probably all-NBA but not the best player on a legitimate contender.",2019-10-12 04:11:50

41,"Stop comparing Porzingis to the AD, Kawhi and PG situations",0,dbozbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dbozbd/stop_comparing_porzingis_to_the_ad_kawhi_and_pg/,74,1569938442.0,"r/nba posters seem to be making this false equivalency argument that every player forcing a trade is interchangeably bad. The difference between the Porzingis situation and the other recent superstar force-outs is quite striking:

**1.) Unlike those stars, Porzingis had no say in being in New York and wasn't offered an extension**

AD and Kahwi had already agreed to max contracts. They chose the payday over the freedom to leave their franchise early by taking the QO. Both the Spurs and the Pelicans were willing to offer supermax extensions at the first opportunity. Paul George re-signed with OKC as a UFA. When you sign a 4-5 year $90m+ contract voluntarily and take that money, barring some exceptional change leading to an unworkable collapse in the relationship you shouldn't force your way out.

Porzingis, on the other hand, wasn't even offered a max extension. He was on his rookie deal (underpaid for a superstar, no choice in where he plays) and facing restricted free agency coming off injury. The franchise demonstrated they were unwilling to commit to him financially because of the risk. Fine, but don't complain when the player already knows other teams will make such a commitment. Dallas not only paid him a full max, but gave him a player option because they know he's that good of a talent.

Porzingis was apparently willing to take the Qualifying Offer or go to Europe the situation was so bad. That's putting your money where your mouth is, unlike guys who take the payday and then force their way out afterwards. Taking the QO would have been bad for both KP AND the Knicks. The fact that the Knicks didn't capitalize better and their plans failed isn't KP's fault.

**2.) Unlike small market teams, New York has no excuse for their underperformance besides their own incompetence. Also, unlike those small market teams, New York as a franchise failed to fully commit to Porzingis as their superstar.**

Besides magically transforming into Los Angeles, I'm not sure what more NO, San Antonio or OKC could have done to keep their players. They were small market teams and have trouble attracting top-flight free agents. New Orleans was probably the worst run of the three, but they fully embraced AD and were constantly trying to put good teams around AD with Jrue and Cousins, but injuries kept getting in the way. San Antonio is widely considered the best run franchise in the league and would still be contending for rings today if Kawhi stayed. OKC was a contender too, and Presti is a great GM. The stars wanted the max years/money and they wanted to still end up in the sexy market.  

But what excuse do the Knicks have? They not only failed to demonstrate their commitment to Porzingis as their star on a bunch of really stupid levels (the coach calling him a ""pussy"", constantly trying to trade him, not giving him a freakin' key to the practice gym all the way across the city so he could get work in), but there's no reason whatsoever the most valuable franchise in the biggest market in the NBA can't attract talent other than rampant incompetence and a terrible reputation for mismanaging their team. How do you attract stars when your owner bans franchise legends for criticizing him? When your own fans boo you simply for getting drafted? When your coaching and management are a revolving door? When you trade your franchise superstar to dump contracts so you have cap space you don't even use (and apparently don't even make an offer to the star you were pursuing in the first place)?

How can anyone claim a rookie contract player who isn't offered an extension and is stuck on a wildly incompetent franchise asking for a trade or else he'll take the QO is equivalent to guys who voluntarily signed max deals with their contending small market teams only to force their way out to a more desirable market after getting your payday is beyond me. Porzingis and his brother-agent probably have some responsibility for the communication breakdown, but the fact is that NY is wholly responsible for the environment they created and their unwillingness to fully commit to KP. They threw him under the bus to deflect blame while KP kept his mouth shut.",He forced his way out of a rookie contract.,"Dude c'mon! Yes the Knicks had some fault for the enviroment he was in, but that doesn't make it ok for him to demand to be traded.

Literally all these comments are conjecture. Some things to keep in perspective:

1) Waiting a year to report a sexual assault is not unusual.

2) Any statement put out by anyone’s lawyer involved in this case is simply posturing in the court of public opinion.  None of these statements hold any water, as they are of ZERO substance to the legal and criminal outcomes.  There is no consequence to outright lying in public statements by attorneys. Only statements to a court or investigative bodies should hold any weight. Note that you can even lie to the public about what you said to an investigative body, as long as you didn’t lie to that body directly.

3) You can be a scumbag generally and not have raped someone. You can also be a nice person generally and have raped someone.  Likewise, you can be a terrible person and have been a sexual assault victim.  A person’s overall demeanor and personality certainly increases or decreases the likelihood something happened, but isn’t definitive.  

4) Circumstantial evidence and testimonial evidence are still evidence in court. 

5) No one knows what happened except for Kristaps and the accuser, and even then, they may have different recollections of what happened.  Although we rely on memory a whole lot during the legal process, it is famously unreliable and subject to manipulation, exaggeration, and sometimes outright mistake.

6) The criminal litigation process can influence but is not determinative of the civil process because the burden of proof is not the same. The criminal standard is “beyond a reasonable doubt” whereas the civil standard is “by a preponderance of the evidence,” which means there is a more than 50% chance something happened.  Remember, OJ Simpson was found not guilty in his criminal trial but was found liable in the civil trial.

7) On that note, in a criminal proceeding, one is NEVER “proven innocent.”  There is only “guilty” or “not guilty.” That means the jury has decided the evidence has proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, or the evidence hasn’t done that.  There is no finding on “innocence.”

Hope the dude can stay healthy,"Dwight is a bit one dimensional but after looking into his advanced numbers I actually good with it. 

He can play PF, with KP at the C on defense. 

Surprisingly, Powell is actually a amazing perimeter defender. And he is a incredible roll man. Check out his rankings:

Skill | Mark
---|---
Perimeter Shot | C-
Off-Ball Movement | B+
One on One | C-
Finishing | A
Roll Gravity  | A
Playmaking | C
Post Play | A- 	
OReb | A-
Perimeter Defense | A-
Interior Defense | C+
DReb | A-

Given that KP can protect the rim and Pick and Pop, and he can play the perimeter and be the perfect PnR partner with Luka. I do think it makes sense to put him in the starting lineup.

We think we've done a good job setting up the team for the future, you're a great player.  We'd love that future to involve you.  But we can get a good deal, we're done.""

Knicks beat reporter Ian Begley then goes on to talk about the Phil Jackson regime and how they may have tried to force a push the summer they signed Derrick Rose, Courtney Lee, and Joakim Noah when they probably should have just blown it up to build around Kristaps.  It may have given the Knicks guidance to decide that they shouldn't try to force the issue with somebody who doesn't want to be there and to just get the best return for him and move forward.

Lowe later brings up:

>“I don’t think, I'm confident after talking to a lot of people, I don't think he was psyched about playing with Durant. I don’t know how directly that was verbalized to the Knicks, but I’m confident that it wasn’t something that was his Plan A, he wanted to be the face of the franchise.  Kemba Walker would not be.  You could argue Kyrie Irving would not be, it would be close.  Kawhi Leonard is so quiet, even if he's the best player on the team (which he would be), he yields the public stage to other people.”

Begley responds talking about the meeting saying that he knows the meeting didn't take long and he doesn't get the sense that there was a desperate attempt by the Knicks to say ""Kristaps, please stay"" or of trying to mend fences, further elaborating that he thinks they were ready to pull the trigger because they knew he was unhappy and were prepared for it.  There were also multiple teams that would have been ready to put an offer on the table for Kristaps had they known, but the Knicks pulled the trigger so quickly that they couldn't.  He further elaborates that he doesn't think the offers they could have put out would accomplish all 3 goals the Knicks wanted, which was cap space, a young player, and pick(s).  

Begley also brings up: 

>“I always got the impression that he would’ve welcomed Kyrie and been excited about Kyrie.”

Kristaps' list of places he wanted to be traded was reported as the Nets, Clippers, Heat, Spurs, and Raptors.  Notably, Kristaps responded on Instagram the night of the trade telling Knicks fans to ""stay woke"", and that ""the truth will come out eventually"".

>The Knicks dealt Kristaps Porzingis to the Mavericks ahead of the February trade deadline, but a new ESPN report suggests a different deal could have been made before the 2018 NBA draft last June. 

ESPN's Zach Lowe reports the Knicks were in talks with the Kings for De'Aaron Fox despite his struggles during his rookie season. In the leadup to last year's draft, the Kings who had the No. 2 pick were interested in drafting Luka Doncic to rebuild the team around the him.

""Rivals sensed the dilemma and made offers for Fox — including a template from the New York Knicks centered around Kristaps Porzingis that would have required Sacramento to either send something beyond Fox or take unwanted Knicks salary (or both), sources say,"" Lowe wrote. 

The Kings picked Marvin Bagley III with the No. 2 pick in the 2018 NBA draft. 

Doncic now plays with Porzingis in Dallas after going No. 3 overall in the 2018 NBA draft. The Knicks received point guard Dennis Smith Jr. and center DeAndre Jordan in exchange for Porzingis.

Fox is averaging 17.4 points and 7.2 assists per game this season, while the Kings are 36–37 and sit in ninth in the Western Conference.

NBA Projected Starting Lineups (with some adjustments made for injured players): [https://www.lineups.com/nba/lineups](https://www.lineups.com/nba/lineups)

Anyway, here's the list, with explanations given where I could think of them.

&#x200B;

**Atlanta Hawks**

PG  Trae Young – Charmander (Young hot shooter)

SG  Kevin Huerter – Caterpie (I’m not going to google every player, some of these are just gonna like, be caterpie)

SF   Cam Reddish – Poliwag (Young guy, can go down a couple evolutionary paths, I clearly don't know a lot about the current Hawks)

PF  John Collins - Oddish (Big potential, nice hair?)

C  Alex Len - Grimer (He's like, sticky? probably)

&#x200B;

**Boston Celtics**

PG  Kemba Walker – Starmie (Fast, good stats, purple, uhh some of these just are what they are)

SG  Jaylen Brown - Ivysaur (Well-rounded, good at Smash Bros)

SF  Gordon Hayward – Primeape (Angry MAGA motherfucker)

PF  Jayson Tatum - Eevee (Big potential, so much opportunity, so many ways to go, might fuck it up and get a Flareon)

C  Enes Kanter - Butterfree (I just want him to have his freedom back, fuck dictators)

&#x200B;

**Brooklyn Nets**

PG  Kyrie Irving – Alakazam (Requested a trade and got it, psychic ball handling, looks like a flat-earther)

SG  Caris LeVert - Fearow (Dude can fly? Please leave better jokes in the comments, this is hard)

SF  Kevin Durant – Zapdos (Legendary long two’s baby, that’s the joke)

PF  Jarrett Allen – Machoke (Might need a trade to reach full potential)

C  DeAndre Jordan – Onix (should not be starting, old but low stats, slow, did not get traded with a metal coat)

&#x200B;

**Charlotte Hornets**

PG  Terry Rozier – Meowth (Got a big payday, not great)

SG  Malik Monk - Metapod (Alliteration is a major factor)

SF  Nicolas Batum – Parasect (Toxic contract)

PF  Miles Bridges - Jigglypuff (Sounds like he can sing)

C  Cody Zeller - Ekans (They have the exact same face and I will not be convinced otherwise)

&#x200B;

**Chicago Bulls**

PG  Tomas Satoransky - Drowzee (Psychic types can dribble apparently, that's the headcannon I made up)

SG   Zach LaVine – Charizard (Iconic dunks, solid shooting, statistically   not that great when you really get into the numbers,    needs a mega   evolution to compete in the metagame)

SF  Otto Porter - Pidgeotto (Dude evolved a little bit, still has room to grow)

PF  Lauri Markkanen - Squirtle (Splash brother in the making)

C  Wendell Carter Jr. - Geodude (Big defensive potential, he can float for no reason I guess)

&#x200B;

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

PG  Collin Sexton – Exeggcute (Big potential, lot of eggs for one basket)

SG  Jordan Clarkson - Goldeen (Don't think about it too much, you shouldn't be reading all of these)

SF  Cedi Osman - Gloom (He's got a chance to evolve, seems like he had an emo phase)

PF  Kevin Love – Pidgeot (Both stunningly beautiful)

C  Tristan Thompson - Clefairy (Strong defensive capabilities, sure I guess)

&#x200B;

**Dallas Mavericks**

PG  Jalen Brunson - Rattata (Never heard of this dude)

SG  Tim Hardaway Jr. – Nidoran Female (Someone has to be Nidoran    Female,    gender is just a construct \[in the Pokemon games, but also in   real   life\])

SF  Dorian Finney-Smith - Pidgey (Never heard of this dude either, is Dallas ok?)

PF  Luka Doncic – Kadabra (Great vision, ahead of his time, something about spoons)

C  Kristaps Porzingis – Omastar (Will be good when back, looks like a total creep)

&#x200B;

**Denver Nuggets**

PG  Jamal Murray – Hypno (I don’t know much about Hypno or Jamal but sure)

SG  Gary Harris – Raichu (Some of these just make perfect sense and I don’t want to research the Denver Nuggets a ton)

SF  Torrey Craig - Krabby (Big meaty claws)

PF  Paul Millsap – Weezing (Underrated defense, something about weed?)

C  Nikola Jokic – Tentacruel (big arms, can do a lot, very strong in the metagame but underrated in the media)

&#x200B;

**Detroit Pistons**

PG  Reggie Jackson - Persian (He evolved but the stats are still not great)

SG  Luke Kennard - Paras (Dude probably does mushrooms)

SF  Bruce Brown - Weedle (Never heard of him, so he has to be Weedle, sorry Detroit)

PF  Blake Griffin – Exeggutor (Good stats, decent ball handling, tall and looks funny)

&#x200B;

**Golden State Warriors**

PG  Stephen Curry – Moltres (Legendary 3’s, get it?)

SG  D'Angelo Russell – Rapidash (He’s pretty fast and can shoot, some of these explanations will not be great)

SF  Klay Thompson – Blastoise (Splash brothers, canons, good defense, loves weed)

PF  Draymond Green – Chansey (Specially defensive, big wall, healing powers for team chemistry?)

C  Willie Cauley-Stein – Machop (Dude just looks like Machop? I dunno it works shhhh)

&#x200B;

**Houston Rockets**

PG Russell Westbrook – Tauros (Charges in fast not much thinking, real     good for the first generation but can't adjust when the metagame   shifts)

SG  James Harden – Arcanine (Of the top twenty in total base stats, Arcanine has the   closest thing to a beard, also fire types are good  shooters for some   reason in my head)

SF  Eric Gordon -Wartortle (Also water types are good shooters but with better defense)

PF  P.J. Tucker – Clefable (Defensive beast, tho doesn’t look like it)

C  Clint Capela – Muk (I don’t know man, someone’s gotta be Muk, good defense, solid stats, poison blob, it all works)

&#x200B;

**Indiana Pacers**

PG  Malcolm Brogdon - Jolteon (Fast and spiky and yellow now)

SG  Victor Oladipo – Aerodactyl (Dangerous when coming back, doesn’t do well with Thunder)

&#x200B;

**Los Angeles Clippers**

PG  Patrick Beverley – Slowbro (Dude is a defensive wall)

SG  Landy Shamet - Bulbasaur (Young guy, might become a big contributor)

SF  Kawhi Leonard – Dragonite (Big claws, kind of a dinosaur but not really, loves apples)

PF  Paul George – Gengar (Evolves by trade, ghosted a few teams, etc.)

C  Ivica Zubac – Zubat (A free space basically)

6th Man Lou Williams – Pikachu (To make 151 there has to be one team  with   6  so Lou Williams is included as Pikachu, everyone’s favorite. He also  is  now voice by Ryan Reynolds.)

&#x200B;

**Los Angeles Lakers**

PG  Rajon Rondo – Raticate – (Dallas fans will get this)

SG   Danny Green – Marowak (Good defense, shell of former self, cannot    handle death with any respect, just look at his Holocaust post)

SF  LeBron James – Mew (Can do it all, been around forever, very cuddly)

PF   Anthony Davis – Gyarados (Imagine the big three-pronged thing as a  unibrow, it was this or Farfetch’d and that’d just be disrespectful)

C  Demarcus Cousins – Snorlax (Big and sleepy, he's gonna take a rest for a while but I hope he's ok)

&#x200B;

**Memphis Grizzlies**

PG  Ja Morant – Abra (Huge potential, hard to catch)

SG  Dillon Brooks - Cubone (I guess Dillon Brooks is Cubone, I'm not      looking him up in case he has tragedies in his history, he just is     Cubone)

SF  Kyle Anderson - Kakuna (He can play defense, right?)

PF  Jaren Jackson Jr. - Hitmonlee (Long legs? No mouth? Absolutely.)

C  Jonas Valanciunas - Beedrill (Big arms but not really great if you look into the stats)

&#x200B;

**Miami Heat**

PG  Goran Dragic – Mr. Mime (There aren't a ton of Dragon types, point      guards have been mostly Psychic, he kind of just gets stuck here, apologies to Goran)

SG  Dion Waiters - Venonat (Seems annoying)

SF  Jimmy Butler – Vaporeon (Good defense, high stats, probably likes Miami more than Minnesota)

PF  James Johnson - Hitmonchan (MMA fighter according to the comments, sounds good)

C  Bam Adebayo – Slowpoke (Big defensive potential, looks sick in pink)

&#x200B;

**Milwaukee Bucks**

PG  Eric Bledsoe – Shellder (This is based off his performance in the playoffs)

SG  Wesley Matthews - Venomoth (Seems annoying but also like decently good)

SF  Khris Middleton – Dewgong (Good stats, but I don’t think anyone notices)

PF  Giannis Antetokounmpo – Mewtwo (Both freaks who make me cry)

C  Brook Lopez – Farfetch’d (This one is perfect and I will not be taking questions)

&#x200B;

C  Karl Anthony-Towns – Lapras (Tall and cold)

&#x200B;

**New Orleans Pelicans**

PG  Jrue Holiday – Dugtrio (The other two are his brothers)

SG  Lonzo Ball – Magnemite (The other two are his brothers, but they won’t get in the league)

&#x200B;

**New York Knicks**

PG  Dennis Smith Jr. - Doduo (Fast, two-faced? Is he? I don't know, maybe)

SG  Reggie Bullock - Koffing (Sure)

SF  RJ Barrett – Dratini (Might take a long time to evolve)

PF  Julius Randle – Poliwrath (I’m not going to write 151 jokes, this is already taking a long time)

C  Mitchell Robinson – Magikarp (Late pick, could have a huge payoff if handled correctly)

&#x200B;

**Oklahoma City Thunder**

PG  Chris Paul – Pinsir (High stats, probably bad for chemistry)

SG  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander – Growlithe (Dude is gonna be a beast later)

SF  Danilo Gallinari – Golduck (Those sound pretty similar name wise)

PG  D.J. Augustin – Kabuto (Ancient)

SG  Evan Fournier - Diglett (I'm running out of steam)

&#x200B;

**Philadelphia 76ers**

PG      Ben Simmons – Victreebell (like the Liberty Bell, get it? Also  would    be really hard for Victreebell to shoot a basketball from 3)

SF  Tobias Harris – Nidoking (More offensive, well-rounded)

PF  Al Horford – Nidoqueen (More defensive, well-rounded)

&#x200B;

**Portland Trail Blazers**

**San Antonio Spurs**

PG  Dejounte Murray - Staryu (Fast, no-look passes cause he doesn't have eyes)

SG  Bryn Forbes - Gastly (He's scary I guess)

SF  DeMar DeRozan – Scyther (Big claws for cutting, if you’re going to trade you need a metal coat or he will not evolve)

PF  Rudy Gay – Omanyte (So old)

C  LaMarcus Aldridge – Venusaur (Great stats, underwhelming media presence)

&#x200B;

**Toronto Raptors**

PG  Kyle Lowry – Seadra (Doesn’t get to be a King this generation, but a championship isn’t bad)

SG  Norman Powell - Nidorino (Normarino)

SF  OG Anunoby - Charmeleon (Kind of like a dinosaur, potential to have a big presence)

PF  Pascal Siakam – Dragonair (Most improved, might be a mythical beast, could just be a cool snake)

&#x200B;

**Utah Jazz**

PG  Mike Conley – Sandslah (Defensive, can slash?)

SG  Donovan Mitchell – Flareon (High attack, high stats, loves jazz music?)

While I don’t necessarily doubt that, why have the Mavericks been given the benefit of the doubt after what’s come out about that organization over the past year. 

They had a 7 month long investigation into their Organization, both front and back office, that concluded that they had been fostering sexual harassment for over two decades. Now in each Porzingis post I see so many upvoted comments about how well their front office communicates and how they have a tight circle of management. I know organizational disfunction doesn’t directly relate to player management but I reject the notion that those two aren’t correlated at all. 

Did everyone just forget that they just had probably the most disturbing NBA news story come out since the Donald Sterling fiasco? I just don’t understand the rose-colored glasses people are using when discussing the Mavericks “culture”. 

The NBA likes to fancy itself the most progressive major sports league but it sure seems like this whole scandal got brushed under the rug real quickly with minimal repercussions...

","It’s more praising how stable their basketball environment is.  They have a rich owner who doesn’t interfere with the GM or Coach.  They have a brilliant coach, an amazing all time player as a vet, and maybe the best young player (that’s been in the league less than 3 years) in the nba","Our locker room is consistently one of the best in the NBA, the women in the sexual misconduct scandal even said the locker room was where they actually felt safe.

There are two other options worth exploring: 

""1) Porzingis signs a short-term deal — three years with a player option — so that he can hit unrestricted free agency sooner, and 2) he signs an offer sheet from another team, thus forcing the Knicks to match.

Regarding No. 2, watch out for the Brooklyn Nets. Sean Marks, the team’s GM, is high on Porzingis, according to a source, and has a history of offering big money to restricted free agents. If the Nets finds themselves out of the running for the top unrestricteds this summer, a smart move would be to throw everything at Porzingis — a max contract with a trade kicker and no protections — while hoping he signs it as quickly as possible.""

It is very possible that poor health and anemia prevent this extremely talented player from becoming a star that can be counted on by a contending team. He's also showing huge signs of being a diva in the recent report showing that he threatened to straight up leave the Knicks to spend the rest of the year in Spain. 

On top of that his brother Janis seems to think he's some sort of Tom Hagen and gave the Knicks an ultimatum for a player that has yet to accomplish anything of note in this league. Even the Mavs and Rick Carlisle are trying to placate him by kissing his ass during the press conference for their new players by saying he's a part of the team. 

On the Knick's side, they got two first round picks, a young player who could be a very good player in DSJ, a shot at a very high pick in the next draft which could end up being Zion, and they have enough cap space for two max contracts next year.

Potentially they could have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and Zion Williamson. Add Knox and DSJ to that and you've definitely got a lot to work with.

There was uncertainty and an hour later he gets traded? For cap space?! We’re trusting the same front office that gave those terrible contracts to Tim Hardaway and Courtney Lee to be smart with cap space?

I’m still not positive I think it is a good move but it’s possible they know something with all the league tampering. Around this time In 2016, there were rumors Durant would join Warriors. These things are contemplated and discussed months ahead of time. Even still, I find it a peculiar move that makes me wonder if they know something more about Porzingis and his ability to stay healthy.

That brings me to Dallas’s side. The more I read about this, the more I feel less bullish about Dallas’s victory here. Draft picks are the life blood of a franchise, even if they are late picks. Just look at Denver, Boston last year, even Utah to see how late lottery or late first round picks can have tremendous value to depth and establishing a strong team.

Essentially the Mavericks have traded the 2017 pick, 2019 pick, unless it is top 5, the next available draft unprotected and the 2023 pick top 10 protected for a core of Porzingis and Doncic. And a year and a half of Courtney plus 2 years of THJ to clear away Wes Matthews and Deandre Jordan, who were expiring after this year. So their books are locked up and they have committed to this core, esp if they resign Porzingis to the max. But he is an injury prone center whose body may not be built to play the reckless athletic style he plays. Was this a smart decision going all in on Porzingis? Even if he signs the qualifying offer and gets off the books after next year, all those draft picks are still gone. The cupboard is barren and we have seen in the past free agents consistently not sign with Dallas, even when they have lots of cap space.

Squandering assets to be immediately competitive is how the Pelicans screwed up with Anthony Davis. You could argue they had terrible injury luck but exactly. Sports are not played in a vacuum. Injuries happen. You could argue Porzingod is only 23 and pairing him with Luka at 19 is a no brainer. But I would argue the margin of error has drastically diminished, the franchise’s timetable has escalated, and the next couple season could make or break the franchise for the coming decade.

**TL,DR: Porzingis is an unbelievable player when healthy. But as we’ve seen, that is not a guarantee. With all the assets traded away, isn’t this actually an incredibly risky move for Dallas and far from the fleecing people are saying it is? This gamble could actually be devastating for the Mavs and potential of that is far greater than initially considered.**","You need to put into perspective the Mavs drafting over the last 20 years. The Best players they drafted were.
