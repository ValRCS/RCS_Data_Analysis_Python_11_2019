While KP clearly has the higher ceiling he is not only coming off an ACL injury at 7'3, but also is set to make 11 million more per year which allows the Knicks another 2nd max slot going forward that a 32 million dollar max signing wouldn't allow them. Not to mention KP got the Knicks DSJ (who is still a young player that's a league average jumper away from having a DLo type year imo), and 2 first round picks in 2021/2023. I mean, if KP reaches his ceiling and Randle stagnates or gets worse I could see this backfiring but until KP proves he is a top 10-15 player, I just don't see how Dallas won this trade.\",\n",

KP has, amazingly, fully lived up to that moniker, posting one of the highest block rates in the league in 2018 while shooting 3s at over 40%. However, the rest of his game is hugely questionable: he was one of the least efficient volume scorer in the league, posted a historical low assist rate for a volume scorer, and was a very poor rebounder. In order to try and project his career ceiling, I looked for other young players with similar profiles to see where their career ended up.\\n\\nI first messed around for a while on BBall Ref trying to find other players who put up high scoring rates, collected very few assists, and weren\\'t very efficient. [My first criteria came up with just KP, and 26 year old John Drew](http://bkref.com/tiny/Bqfm4). Loosening it slightly came up with [more John Drew, an old Moses, and some other good but not great players](http://bkref.com/tiny/Bqfm4). Compared to league average TS%, KP is actually at the bottom of this group in efficiency. Loosening the volume scoring criteria [lumps Porzingis with some very good and very bad players](http://bkref.com/tiny/hZtp1), and it becomes clear that this approach isn\\'t gonna be all that revelatory.\\n\\nI then went for an approach that better reflected his overall two-way game. I found three clubs that seemed fitting for KP:\\n\\n[Players age 23 and under, 25+ pts/100, 2.5+ blk/100, <2.5 AST/100](http://bkref.com/tiny/oJ6xf)\\n\\nThis captures all 3 of Porzingis\\'s seasons, and lumps him in with a varied group of players. We see him grouped with future superstars like Shaq and Hakeem, a comparable young player in Jaren Jackson Jr, and some solid players like Big Z and McDyess. The only issue is that even within this group, KP is an outlier: his most scoring rate is the highest on the list by far, and he\\'s dead at the bottom of the heap with McDyess in relative TS%. His assist/usage ratio is also the worst of all these players.\\n\\n[All players, 30+ pts/100, 2.5+ blk/100, <2.5 ast/100](http://bkref.com/tiny/aQfEv)\\n\\nI removed the age filter in order to find more big volume scoring seasons like Kristaps\\' 17-18. Here, KPnis grouped exclusively with HoFers and a young Brook Lopez, but he\\'s radically less efficient than the entire rest of the list. His supporting cast was also probably the worst, but Lopez and Davis both also had very rough supporting casts.\\n\\n[Players age 23 and under, >25% usage, 2.5+ blk/100, <2.5 ast/100](http://bkref.com/tiny/ktmwr)\\n\\nThe group narrows to just Porzingis, McDyess, and HoFers. This reflects the same pattern as before: KP is radically less efficient than other young bigs with high usage, serious defensive talent, and very limited passing.\\n\\nThe reason I keep pinpointing on Porzingis\\' efficiency is that I don\\'t think it\\'s something that\\'ll just change overnight on a good team. Porzingis shot fantastically from 3 and posted a fairly high free throw rate in 2018. If his shooting regresses and/or his reduced role in Dallas doesn\\'t allow him to draw as many fouls, the efficiency gains he makes from other areas improving could be largely erased. I don\\'t doubt that he\\'ll probably get to above average efficiency as he improves, but I don\\'t think he\\'s ever going to really efficient without taking far less shots.\\n\\nOverall, Porzingis is a complete outlier, both for better and for worse. I think looking through past comparisons gives a lot of clarity as to what he *isn\\'t*, but does less to illuminate what he *is*. \\n\\nThe comparison that strikes me most is actually a guy that didn\\'t show up in these comps: **Rasheed Wallace**. Like Porzingis, Wallace was a stretch big with excellent defense, but had limitations that put a ceiling on his offensive impact. Wallace never put up the same scoring rates KP has, but he was more efficient and better as a passer. I think like Wallace, KP can peak as a top 11-15 player in the league, but it\\'s unlikely he\\'ll ever be a franchise player type guy. \\n\\n**TLDR:** Kristaps Porzingis is much better on defense than other inefficient young volume scorers, but much less efficient than other young volume scoring defensive bigs. He\\'s also really fucking bad at passing. IMO he will probably peak as an All-NBA level guy, but not a franchise player.',\n",

While KP clearly has the higher ceiling he is not only coming off an ACL injury at 7'3, but also is set to make 11 million more per year which allows the Knicks another 2nd max slot going forward that a 32 million dollar max signing wouldn't allow them. Not to mention KP got the Knicks DSJ (who is still a young player that's a league average jumper away from having a DLo type year imo), and 2 first round picks in 2021/2023. I mean, if KP reaches his ceiling and Randle stagnates or gets worse I could see this backfiring but until KP proves he is a top 10-15 player, I just don't see how Dallas won this trade.\",\n",
